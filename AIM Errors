I've saved this chat.  You can return to it anytime to continue working on the pagination implementation.

**Quick Summary of Where We Left Off:**

The issue is that form generation uses `BaseInventoryTemplate` (via `FormGeneratorViewModel` → `FormTemplateFactory`), NOT the `DirectoryOperationService` we updated. 

**To fix the pagination, you need to update these files:**

1. **`BaseInventoryTemplate.cs`** - Inject `IPrintPaginationService` and use it instead of the hardcoded `PaginateLevel2Section` method

2. **`OhioInventoryTemplate.cs`** and **`IMInventoryTemplate.cs`** (or similar) - Update constructors to pass the pagination service to base class

3. **`FormTemplateFactory.cs`** - Inject `IPrintPaginationService` and pass it when creating template instances

The code for these updates is in my previous message. Once you make those changes, the intelligent pagination (keeping Level 3 headers with their content, preventing orphaned headers) should work correctly.
